API for my clicker game.

Express app for little overhead and easy customization. A pretty straightforward API with only a couple end points for handling user login, updating user progress and game logic.

crypto-js and jsonwebtoken for encryption of user password, handling auth, and maintaining user login.

mongodb and mongoose to store user data, track progress
